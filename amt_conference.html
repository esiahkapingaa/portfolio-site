          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">Background:</p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            “Entrepreneurship with life in abundance (leaving life in alignment with the word of God) took 
            us back to the journey of the Israelites from Egypt to the promised land. 600 men left the land, in 
            approximate of 3 million people altogether. But only 2 reached the promised land of original people, 
            who were Joshua and Caleb.” 
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">What influences people?</p>
          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">Him:</p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            When I went to the US for the entrepreneur (leadership) program. One of the professors asked. 
            Between the media and the people, what influences the other? I said, <em>THE PEOPLE</em>. Then the professor 
            said you wrong, sir. <em>“The media influences the people,”</em> he continued explaining… Now these are things 
            that get people influenced.  
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">People get influenced through:</p>  
          <p class="mt-2">
            ▹ Pressure (Media)<br/>  
            ▹ Trauma  
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">Passion:</p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            ▹ Something that makes you do something. Something you wake up for;<br/>
            ▹ look for something that drives you to work without clock checks.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">Talent is not Enough:</p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            If you have a recognized talent, GOOD. but it's not enough to get you to where you want to be.<br/>
            ▹ Get skills and other resources.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            “When I wanted to make a new investment, I asked one of the prominent men in Zambia. JITO 
            KAYUMBA—A Special Assistant to the President for Financial, Economic, and Investment Plans. I 
            asked him, <em>"What do you look for in a company you want to invest in?"<br/>
            </em> He said, <em>“Is it scalable?”</em> 
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            So one thing you have to look for in a business you want to invest in is the scalability of that business. 
            Once I identified that, I had to cut off certain things in the Atmosphere nation till we made our business 
            scalable and we had reached 75+ million streams across albums.  
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">Vertical Integration:</p> 
          <p class="mt-2">
            ▹ You have to be vertically integrated; integration is either upward toward natural resources or 
            downward toward the customers.<br/>  
            ▹ The potential examples from the Bible are from. Our father of faith is Abraham. He was vertically 
            integrated; he owned wells, grazing yards, and livestock, essential for humanity. The second is the 
            woman in found in this passage  
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2"><em>Proverbs 31:13-27<br/>“She seeks wool and flax and works with willing hands.”</em></p>
          <p class="mt-2">▹ This woman also was vertically integrated. She made fabrics from wool and clothes from fabrics.</p>

        <div class="text-justify">
          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">Title: LESSONS FROM MY MISTAKES</p>
          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">① When You Become Gig-Headed, You Create Competition.</p>  
          <p class="mt-2">
            ▹ When we were at the top with the printing machine in Zambia. We thought we had reached it and 
            never had to look on both sides. ↳ Because the money in printing machines isn’t in selling printing 
            machines but in selling consumables.<br/>  
            ▹ I thought we were the best, so we introduced the competition, and our potential customers started 
            buying from other companies.  
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">② Lack Of Vision For Your Company Makes You Dig Your Grave.</p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            ▹ You need to have a bigger vision.<br/>  
            ▹ If your vision is big enough, when you have the money, you will always and immediately run to buy 
            liabilities instead of investing your money to grow the company.  
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">③ If You Want Power and Control, You Don't Deserve Support.</p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            ▹ When I wanted to start an institute, that was the DLN Entrepreneurship Institute. I wanted to have full 
            control. I had a hunger for power that I coined the name of the institution already and needed no 
            change way before the investors. This led to having no investors in the institute as the start-up company, 
            and eventually I invested alone.  
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">④ Don't OverInvest Without Fully Understanding The Business.</p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            ▹ Every business has its own language. Always try to learn and understand it. As the DLN group 
            comprises many businesses, when I started, I thought all of them were the same. But no, when I was 
            starting up an institute from the DLN tech. It was a different story. I invested 7 Million in total and made 
            a loss of 10 Million in total.<br/>  
            ▹ I made very unnecessary investments and positions without students or any potential investor, which 
            still made it worse.  
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">⑤ There Is Always Somthing To Knock You Out.</p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            ▹ When Covid-19 Came. Our institute was just beginning. Rented, and we haven't even made a profit 
            from it yet. And you know we have a national quarantine; every institute is closed, and we had to close 
            also. But wait,<br/>  
            ▸ The rentals didn’t close.▸ The DLN Tech had limited supplies because our buyers closed too. Meaning 
            <em>∞ Cash flow reduced → Wages increased.</em><br/>  
            ▹ Our company started drawing, and we drew because we had employees and rent to pay while the cash 
            wasn’t showing up.  
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">⑥ A Moment Of Reckoning Always Comes.</p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            ▹ When you find yourself in such kind of situations, you have to take time to think about what’s wrong 
            and how you can come back. I did that.<br/>  
            ▹ I left the fancy offices with glasses and went to my roots, where I couldn’t pay any rentals. I moved 
            my office to our house on Great North Road.<br/>  
            ▹ I reduced the spending so I can just meet up with repayment and wages in need.  
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">⑦ Shrinking Was The Best Decision That Allowed Me To Rise Again.</p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            ▹ Reposition yourself. I decided to shrink.<br/>  
            ▹ I had to cut off certain positions in our company, such as secretary, HR, whatever. I only needed the 
            assistant.<br/>   
            # Now here is where the problem comes with a lot of people. Thinking too much about what others are 
            going to think and see. The truth is those people are not the ones in the situation, and they will not get 
            you out of that situation and are never going to pay your bills.<br/>  
            ▹ Since we shrank and cut off certain spendings, we made a powerful comeback, and I can testify that 
            we have done and been doing massively better than we were making.<br/>  
            ▹ Shrinking has made me bounce back.

          <p class="mt-2 "><strong>Closing Remark</strong><br/>By Dr. Dumisani Lingamalinga Ncube</p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            “Who are more risk takers? Employees or self-employed individuals (startup).  
            You know the common view is that. Self-employed people are the risk takers. But here is my take: 
            employees are the risk takers. You know why? Because these people spend many years in school, for 
            example, 4 years, and to get the job, on average, takes 6 years. So you spend your 6 years just to start 
            getting a salary. Now here is the comeback: how much would you have made or how far would you have 
            gone if you had pushed for your enterprise 6 years back?  
            And these people think they are more secure than the self-employed, but NO! When a business 
            collapses, the first to be affected are the employees. When the mining company closes or loses in shares 
            or anything, the first to be affected are the employees. So where is the security in being employed?  
            ,Why do you think you are more secure and safe if you have been employed instead of running your 
            own business?”

          <p class="mt-2">
            I am new to business and investment, and this is the time that I want to step in.  
            Since you, Mr. Dumisani, You are an entrepreneur, when beginning a business, do you go for what is on 
            the market or with passion?  
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">Dr. Dumisani Ling’amang’ali Ncube:</p>
          <p class="mt-2 text-justify">
            That’s a good question. Do you go for passion or what’s on the market?  
            Well, sometimes passion won’t pay your bills. I’ll advise that most of the time you go with what is on 
            the market, and then when you have the funds, you run with your passion. Because money will fund 
            your passion. As for me, this is my passion, standing here and talking to you all, but this won’t pay bills 
            or bring you here, so I have businesses I run to finance my passion. I’m sure all of you here wouldn’t 
            have been here if it wasn’t for my business. So yes, go with what is on the market, then run your 
            passion. However, glory to Jesus if your passion can bring you money. Go for it.
